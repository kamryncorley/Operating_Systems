Bothell File System (BFS) Implementation
This repository contains an implementation of the Bothell File System (BFS), a Unix-like filesystem designed as a project for
understanding filesystem architecture and operations at a low level. BFS is structured across three main layers: fs (user-level 
filesystem operations), bfs (internal BFS functions), and bio (block I/O operations), enabling a comprehensive approach to filesystem management.

Overview
BFS simulates a simple yet functional filesystem comprising 100 blocks, each 512 bytes, providing a basic platform for file storage operations.
It supports creating, reading, writing, seeking, and closing files with an interface that abstracts the complexity of block-level operations 
to user-friendly file operations.
